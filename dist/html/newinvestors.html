<h class="title">Welcome New Investors!</h><br><br>

<div class="posttitle">Why Invest?</div>

<div class="posts">
Investing, like eating and sleeping, is done by everyone, but done correctly by few. There is no purer form
of self improvement than proper investing. Thousands of years ago, written in scripture,
man realized the importance of saving now for future benefits. Humans learned to store
food to ensure nurishment in winter. Teaching a man to fish now will feed him and his family for a life time.
<br><br>

Investing is more than saving money. It is the selection of future benefits over
current impulses. Investing can be aggregating money to spend on a life-long memorable trip.
You may save up for your own or your child's college tuition. You could even invest time into education
knowing your learned skills will earn you money in the future. You may even be interested in investing to blow
it all on a banger in Las Vegas.
<br><br>


<br><br>
<div class="posttitle">What is Investing</div>
No matter how you choose what you want to invest in, there are two key elements to investing.
<br><br>
1) A goal with a defined end-point
<br><br>
2) A commitment to consistency
<br><br>
Whether you are investing time in the gym to obtain an optimal physic, or time on the golf course
to better your game, everything you do is an investment of at least time and often money.
<br><br>
Is what you are investing in aligned with your future goals or present desires?
<br><br>
Investing in what you want is the only way obtain it. The first step is defining your goals.<br><br>


<div class="posttitle">Finding What You Want in Life</div>
This website will not be focused on helping you find what you want.
There are many websites online that specialize in that and would be
much better resources.<br><br>
Here are a few:
<a href="https://www.actualized.org/life-purpose-course" class="link">Actualized.org</a>
<a href="https://www.tonyrobbins.com/stories/date-with-destiny/what-is-my-purpose/" class="link">Tony Robins</a>
<a href="https://selfauthoring.com/" class="link"> Jordan Peterson</a>
<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/click-here-happiness/201712/five-steps-finding-your-life-purpose" class="link">Random Blogs</a>
<br>
Understanding Yourself and Defining a Life Purpose are the keys to finding Meaning in Life and Setting Goals to Improve Your Life and Others'.<br>
Your Life Purpose can start small, like passing a class, but over time, your thirst for meaning and purpose will grow along with your goals.<br><br>
Spend time thinking about your goals before you begin putting money in the market.<br><br>
The only way to be successful in the market is to set targets and be consistent.<br>
<br><br>

<div class="posttitle">Financial Investment the FMI Way</div><br>
<h class="title" style="font-size:30px;">Fees</h>
In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Unshakeable-Your-Financial-Freedom-Playbook-ebook/dp/B01KU08VQE/ref=pd_sim_351_1?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B01KU08VQE&pd_rd_r=1964d897-157f-11e9-a96d-590add2e911b&pd_rd_w=pAmse&pd_rd_wg=dYXNM&pf_rd_p=18bb0b78-4200-49b9-ac91-f141d61a1780&pf_rd_r=3614EPHZ6R35K6FFVPN8&psc=1&refRID=3614EPHZ6R35K6FFVPN8"> Tony Robbins's Money Master the Game</a> investors learn the <a href="https://www.tonyrobbins.com/wealth-lifestyle/401k-fees-matter-video/">major difference that 1% in fees can make.</a> Using a trading service or investing in a fund with relatively higher fees can cost you hundreds of thousands in retirement. The lower the fees the better. Zero fees is optimal.<br><br>

<h class="title" style="font-size:30px;">Commitment</h><br>
Commitment to investing is absolutely critical once you get started. If you put $100 into an investment account and watch it sit, you will have ~$1600 in 30 years, which might feel like a lot today, but will most likely not be a lot of money relative to your salary once you're older.<br>
Instead, if you put in $100 every month for the next 30 years, you will be sitting on almost $200,000. Enough to put a down payment on a house or pay for College Education.<br>
Let's say on average, with promotions, you earn a 5% raise every year and increase your commitment by 5% acoordingly; you will be sitting with $206,000 in 30 years. Not a huge difference right?<br>
Let's instead say every 5 years you double your commitment. Year 5 $200/month, year 10 $400/month ect..; now you will own a $980,000 goose egg!<br><br>
But what if you committed $250/month right in the beginning and never looked back? $460,000<br><br>
So what is important here isn't the amount you start investing today. What is important is that you start with something a <b>Grow</b> that amount over time as you earn more.<br>
If you missed the first 10 years of our $980,000 scenario, but started investing $400/month beginning in year 10, you will be left with $800,000. That is almost a $200,000 difference in the future of what would have been $12,000 during that time (Year 1 - year 10).<br><br>
The point is, due to compounding and market returns, investing whatever you can today, even a small amount, and staying consistent, will yield huge returns in the future.
