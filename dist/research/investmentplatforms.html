Gone are the days of $7 per trade transactions fees offered by sites such as <a href="http://www.etrade.com">ETRADE</a> or <a href="https://www.scottrade.com">Scottrade</a>. I, along with millions of others, have been subjected to these atrocious fees since the beginning of internet trading.
<br>
<br>
These fees forced 1 of 2 outcomes:<br>
1) Trade Large Volume of a Single Security - losing the benefit of diversification<br>
2) Invest in Index Funds and Hold for the Long Run - losing the potential benefit of beating the market
<br>
<br>

However, revolutionary softwares have recently been created that has turned the online investment industry upside down.
<br>
<a href="http://share.robinhood.com/ryank339">Robinhood</a> and <a href="https://www.acorns.com/invite/ZQZWVH">Acorns</a> are the most notable and will be discussed here.

<b>Robinhood</b>
Robinhood is my personal favorite trading platform for one reason. <a href="https://support.robinhood.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001226846-Trading-Fees-on-Robinhood"> There are NO COMMISSION FEES</a>. Fees may sound small, $7 per trade, or 1% of asset value, but many people overlook the long term impact these fees have on their investment accounts.
