Gold has been long used as a currency due to its scarecity, malleability, beauty, and overall uniqueness.
<b>Scarecity</b>
<br>
Unlike diamonds or metals, gold cannot be manufactured from other raw materials (unless you are an alchemist, if so, please e-mail me), and thus, is scarce. Gold is continued to be mined and production grows annually, however, many speculate that there is <a href="https://www.usmoneyreserve.com/blog/how-much-gold-is-in-the-world/">only 57,000 tons left to be mined</a>. Currently estimates state that <a href="https://www.usmoneyreserve.com/blog/how-much-gold-is-in-the-world/"> there is ~244,000 tons of gold on earth </a>. And until we find our alchemist, this will always stay the case. Thus, it is a special material that we can all agree has inherent value in its rarity, scarecity, and unmanufacturability.

<b>Gold's Value</b>
Gold itself as a raw material has some value. It is used in many electronics and spacecraft due to its conductivity characteristics. However, its value as a conductor is small as it can and often is substituted for lower grade metals with similar conductivity.
<br>
Gold's real value lies in its historic uses as currency and its future possibility to become our global currency. Today, you can take a flight to Europe with USD, get your USD converted or even sometimes, pay for things with USD. This ability is a benefit from our global currency markets. The system works very well for advanced countries with strong dollars. However, for weaker dollar countries, it often is very difficult for citizens to travel outside of their country due to the fiscal barriers to entry.
<br>
<br>
Gold is a current solution to that problem as gold can be carried of the flight and exxchanged for whatever currency you'd like.
