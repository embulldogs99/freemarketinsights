<div class='title'>Identifying the Catalyst</div>
<br>
<div class='vertical'>
  Have you invested in a stock, hoping it would go up, only to watch it stagnate for months or years at a time? You may have investigated teh company's fundamentals, determined it was trading at a discount, and threw money at it expecting other investors to jump on. You did everything right but forgot to step on home plate. The final step of finding the best investment opportunity is identifying the <b>catalyst</b>.
  <br>
  As described in this research paper.... the catalyst is the initial snowball that heightens other investors' awareness about a particular stock. Often it is a press release, official announcement, news coverage, a famous investor buying the stock, increasing or new investment analyst coverage, growing trading volumes, a positive earnings release, a political event, or even an environmental crisis. Some event will get the stock highlighted in the news or public eye and investors will flock once being reminded of the opportunity.
  <br>
  The key then is identifying these opportunities either right before or during the catalyst. That is what we do here at FMI. We scoure the internet for every stock, looking for cataclysmic mentions in the market. We then asses the company's fundamentals, consider analyst opinions, and then fire away. Often times the stock takes off. Other times, the catalyst isn't strong enough. At the point, the best move is to sell for no gain and try again. If a stock hasn't been mentioned in the news for the past 3-6 months, it is likely time to move on to other opportunities.
  <br>
  Continue to check in on your stocks to ensure analysts are covering your stocks and are continuing to issue target prices above the current price and buy/hold ratings. If investment bankers are issuing negative return target prices and sell ratings, it is time to sell or buy puts as this is what the mutal funds and institutional investors will be doing as well.
  <br>
  Remember, the institutions are working with very large sums of money. Therefore, they are forced to move slowly and be sure of their direction. Us smaller investors can take advantage of this by getting in near the catalyst and riding the curve as the banks slowly redistribute their dollars within their large funds.
