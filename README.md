# Free Market Insights
<i> The Freemium Analysis Platform for Stocks</i>

<b>Our Mission</b><br>

There is an overload of Financial Information on the web. A quick search will provide millions of news articles and sales pitches with the "Next Hottest Stock". The information overload makes it impossible to know what is important and what is noise. The reason the market is like this, is because "Financial Advising" is almost always packaged with brokeraging.
<br>
<br>
What does this mean? It means that every financial advisor is giving you 'advice' to buy their stock because they have gone through the trouble of obtaining a license to <b>sell</b> you stock. If you do not invest in their portfolios and pay their fees, they <b> don't make their money</b>
<br>
<br>
At FreeMarketInsights, we want to empower people to invest in their future without the burdens of % of assets fees and trade commissions.
<br>
<br>
The internet has brought us innovative banking and finance applications, unprecedented data access, and cost reduction automation.
<br>
Now we have applications such as <a href="https://www.robhinhood.com"> Robin Hood Trading</a> and other trading platforms that are offering abilities to trade at near 0 costs. There is no need for a broker or advisor. Investing is easy, and if you are timid, invest in an index stock and earn the ~8-10% annual market return for 0 cost. For the first time in history, your retirement fund is only a few clicks away.
<br>
<br>

<br>

<b>The Main Takeaway</b><br>
$10,000 today will be worth ~$200,000 in 30 years if invested in the stock market. Not everyone has $10,000 on hand right now, but with commitment and consistency, we save some today, which will grow to a larger sum tomorrow, which will snowball into a significant amount in the future. Investing is a strategy to avoid debt. It is a strategy to have a better life. Make tomorrow better by making the right choice today.
