  <h> EPS and Peter Lynch </h> <br><br>
  <p>
    In his book
      <a class="link2" href="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?ServiceVersion=20070822&OneJS=1&Operation=GetAdHtml&MarketPlace=US&source=ac&ref=qf_sp_asin_til&ad_type=product_link&tracking_id=embulldogs99-20&marketplace=amazon&region=US&placement=0743200403&asins=0743200403&linkId=878e479b847b1fd021721a2f8ae61582&show_border=false&link_opens_in_new_window=false&price_color=333333&title_color=0066C0&bg_color=FFFFFF">One Up on Wall Street</a>
    Peter Lynch walks us through his method of investing.
    He suggests you should know your prospective
    investment company. You should buy small
    companies which inherently have big potential.
    Never buy hot stocks because they always fizzle out quickly,
    and find a niche company
  with a strong balance sheet.
  <br><br>
  However,
  his primary arguement is buy a stock with growing dividends and EPS.
  <br><br>

  <div class="images">
    <img src="/pics/walmart.jpg" width="60%" height="400px">
      We see Walmart experienced strong stock price growth as dividends and earnings skyrocket
    <img src="/pics/ford.jpg" width="90%" height="400px">
    <p>
      Another example is Ford <br>
      This is not proof that dividends and earnings <b><i>Cause</b></i> stock price growth.<br>
      We are simply observing a strong correlation with explanatory power.
    </p>

  Peter Lynch obviously knows what he is doing
  and has sold over a million copies of his book:
  implying other traders are investing this way also;
  which strengthens this trend.
  <br><br>
  This interests us, <b><i>NOT</i></b> to go and find a random
  small stock that has increasing Dividends
  and EPS and invest in it.
  Here at Insights, we search for anomolies.
  We look at the market, determine how it functions,
  and find instances when it temporarily breaks;
  knowing that the market will fix itself with time and we will be the
  ones who got in early and profit
  <br><br>
  So we look at the data
  <br><br>
  Below we show Basic EPS for the SnP 600 Small
  <br>
  We observe if the EPS today was larger than the prior EPS<br>
  If so, we reward a 1.<br>
  We filter and are left with the stocks who have grown EPS most successfully
  over the past 9 reporting periods.<br><br>
  The Average stock price of the SnP 600 is $38<br>
  Interestingly, The Average stock price of these top 50 stocks is $52: Evidence that
  the market trades on EPS growth <br><br>
  Highlighted in yellow, we find a couple outlier stocks, much cheaper than the rest.<br>
  We can see that MDXG recently did not grow EPS, and has been severly punished for it<br>
  Missing EPS may be an oportune buying catalyst for the intelligent investor<br>
  We are left with ORIT as our anomoly worth further investigation.<br>
