    <div class='title'> A Review of Analyst Target Price Accuracy</div>
    As you may have noticed sticking around FMI for a while, Analysts at Investment Banks set target prices often. Daily, we see in the news analysts making their buy/sell/hold recommendations and attempting to predict where the stock will go. They leverage macro economic data, stock fundamentals, industry trends, and technical indicators to make their predictions. The question is, how often are they right?
    <br>
    <br>
    Here at FMI, we have the data that those analysts don't want us to analyze. So lets begin.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <ul id='metastats'></ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <table class='sortable'><tbody id='bankstats'></tbody></table>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    First off, in the news we see two distinct types of predictions. Consensus Targets and Specific Bank Targets.
    <br>
    <br>
    Historically, in other model runs, Consensus target prices have performed rather inaccurately. It always appears that there are some overly aggresive analyst(s) shifting the mean up and the stock never performs. However, the more conservative Investment Banks often do quite well and even beat the market.
    <br>
    <br>
    Our learning from this analysis is twofold: 1) Don't always trust Consensus Targets as averages can be scewed and 2) Invest in the stocks that are followed by the most accurate and Conservative Investment Banks to limit your risk and maximize your return.
