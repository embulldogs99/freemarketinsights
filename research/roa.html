  <h>ROA Shows Excessive Returns</h>
  <p>

    I first discovered the excessive tendancies of High ROA - Return on Assets- Stocks<br>
    a few years ago reading Asness, Frazzini, and Pedersen's <a class="link2" href="http://bit.ly/2v5MWQF">Quality Minus Junk</a><br>
    <br>
    Return on Assets is a metric of how much Net Income is earned from an Asset Base   ROA = NI / A<br>
    <br>
    They found excess returns, and the work acts as one of the first complex, comprehensive,<br>
    and competitive stock models that attempts to incorperate most of the prior academic research.<br>
    <br>
    However, they only use ROA as a single component of their theorized high quality stock.<br>
    <br>
    The variable blending done in the paper causes a blocks visibility to the prominent drivers<br>
    <br>
    As investors become aware and can incorperate the learnings and strategies present in <br>
    this paper, the market will adjust to incorperate the awareness of the new learnings,<br>
    but will still act irrationally around the weightings of the relevant variables<br>
    <br>
    This behavior may cause return swings between variables where one Metric or Characteristic<br>
    becomes the flavor of the month/year/ect.<br>
    but the duration may be variable as well.<br>
    <br>
    Considering these market behaviors, we like to look for sustained and consistent market returns<br>
    which may shed insight on factors that are overbought/overvalued or are just beginning to<br>
    become a fad.<br>
    <br>
    I am continuing to gather data to conduct additional tests on ROA,<br>
    however, looking at monthly returns over the past two years,<br>
    we see a significant return differential between stocks selected with the model ( 1's )<br>
    and those that were not ( 0's )<br>
    <br>
    <img src="/pics/ROA-8-4.JPG"><br>
    <br>
    Stocks with a       4 * ROA > 2  --->     ROA > 1/2   <br>
    <br>
    saw a <b>4 month</b> annualized return of <b>32%</b> while the rest of the market grew 22%.<br>
    <br>
    This formula was actually even more optimized before I rounded up to generalize the concept<br>
    in attempts to not overly optimize the data set.<br>
    <br>
    It may be interesting to note that the trend does not appear to persist in months 5 as the<br>
    data becomes old news.<br>
    <br>
    The Asset and Net Income values were pulled at the fiscal year end for the SnP600 stocks
    and were held into the following year, implying the market took ~4 months to accurately rebalance funds<br>
    to reflect the new information.<br>
    <br>
    This result is surprising for a 2017 world where technology should be making these moves occur<br>
    much more quickly.<br>
    <br>
    To differentiate between a recent and now dead fad, or a persistent pattern is difficult.<br>
    Even with the grandest of datasets, there can still be questions of fad durations and current<br>
    market conditions never reacting like previous time periods.<br>
    <br>
    However, I do enjoy retesting research I've read years ago that was published even many more year<br>
    before, and still finding replications of previous market observations.<br>
    <br>
    Until Artifical Intelligence reaches financial markets and implements methodologies unimaginable<br>
    by a human mind, we will likely continue to: identify, attempt to capitalize on, snowball with other investors<br>
    and subsequently repeat trends that have happened before.<br>
    <br>
    Concepts from Human Psychology and Game Theory echo this result and suggest the game being played may<br>
    be reduced to one of timing.<br>
    Determining when to exit is always difficult as these excess returns may be driven by a few big winners<br>
    which can be easy to exit prematurly, and just as easy to wait too long with a passive strategy.<br>
<br>

  <h> A Note on Dividend Growth</h>
  <p>To round off our analysis of Peter Lynch's <a class="link2" href="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?ServiceVersion=20070822&OneJS=1&Operation=GetAdHtml&MarketPlace=US&source=ac&ref=qf_sp_asin_til&ad_type=product_link&tracking_id=embulldogs99-20&marketplace=amazon&region=US&placement=0743200403&asins=0743200403&linkId=878e479b847b1fd021721a2f8ae61582&show_border=false&link_opens_in_new_window=false&price_color=333333&title_color=0066C0&bg_color=FFFFFF">One Up on Wall Street</a>
    we must take a look at the stock prices of Dividend Growth stocks.<br><br>
    Dividends are the most direct way for an investor to earn cash from a company<br>
    A few reasons why dividend growth may predict future stock appreciation are: <br>
    1) The company is in good health since it can afford to pay dividends <br>
    2) Management's chosen dividend strategy will likely until new management comes in<br>
    3) Wealthy conservative investors use dividends as income streams and are always researching<br><br>
    Some investors choose not to respect dividends in fear that the company has run out of investments opportunities for its cash flows.<br><br>
    Here at FMI, we consider opinions, but assess the data to determine current truth. <br>
    Let's see how companies who quarter over quarter grow Dividends stack up compared to other stocks <br><br>
    Keeping with Lynch's "Small Stock" suggestion, we observe the SnP 600 which has an average stock price of $38. <br><br>
    Below we has the top 50 Dividend Growth stocks in the Snp600.<br><br>
    The average stock price is <b>$56</b> a near <b>50% premium</b> to the market.<br><br>
    We Observe MHLD as an aparent outlier with a stock price of $15 and 9 quarters straight of Dividend Growth.<br><br>
